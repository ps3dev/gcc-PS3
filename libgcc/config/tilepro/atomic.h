/* Atomic instruction macros

   The macros provided by atomic.h simplify access to the TILE-Gx
   architecture's atomic instructions.  The architecture provides a
   variety of atomic instructions, including "exchange", "compare and
   exchange", "fetch and ADD", "fetch and AND", "fetch and OR", and
   "fetch and ADD if greater than or equal to zero".

   No barrier or fence semantics are implied by any of the atomic
   instructions for manipulating memory; you must specify the barriers
   that you wish explicitly, using the provided macros.

   Any integral 32- or 64-bit value can be used as the argument
   to these macros, such as "int", "long long", "unsigned long", etc.
   The pointers must be aligned to 4 or 8 bytes for 32- or 64-bit data.
   The "exchange" and "compare and exchange" macros may also take
   pointer values.  We use the pseudo-type "VAL" in the documentation
   to indicate the use of an appropriate type.  */

/* Atomic instruction macros

   The macros provided by atomic.h simplify access to the Tile
   architecture's atomic instructions.  Since the architecture
   supports test-and-set as its only in-silicon atomic operation, many
   of the operations provided by this header are implemented as
   fast-path calls to Linux emulation routines.

   Using the kernel for atomic operations allows userspace to take
   advantage of the kernel's existing atomic-integer support (managed
   by a distributed array of locks).  The kernel provides proper
   ordering among simultaneous atomic operations on different cores,
   and guarantees a process can not be context-switched part way
   through an atomic operation.  By virtue of sharing the kernel
   atomic implementation, the userspace atomic operations
   are compatible with the atomic methods provided by the kernel's
   futex() syscall API.  Note that these operations never cause Linux
   kernel scheduling, and are in fact invisible to the kernel; they
   simply act as regular function calls but with an elevated privilege
   level.  Note that the kernel's distributed lock array is hashed by
   using only VA bits from the atomic value's address (to avoid the
   performance hit of page table locking and multiple page-table
   lookups to get the PA) and only the VA bits that are below page
   granularity (to properly lock simultaneous accesses to the same
   page mapped at different VAs).  As a result, simultaneous atomic
   operations on values whose addresses are at the same offset on a
   page will contend in the kernel for the same lock array element.

   No barrier or fence semantics are implied by any of the atomic
   instructions for manipulating memory; you must specify the barriers
   that you wish explicitly, using the provided macros.

   Any integral 32- or 64-bit value can be used as the argument
   to these macros, such as "int", "long long", "unsigned long", etc.
   The pointers must be aligned to 4 or 8 bytes for 32- or 64-bit data.
   The "exchange" and "compare and exchange" macros may also take
   pointer values.  We use the pseudo-type "VAL" in the documentation
   to indicate the use of an appropriate type.

   The 32-bit routines are implemented using a single kernel fast
   syscall, as is the 64-bit compare-and-exchange.  The other 64-bit
   routines are implemented by looping over the 64-bit
   compare-and-exchange routine, so may be potentially less efficient.  */

   atomic instruction to enter a critical section, then reads one or
   more values within the critical section without checking to see if
   the critical section was in fact acquired, and only later checks
   the atomic instruction result to see if the lock was acquired.  If
   so the routine could properly release the lock and know that the
   values that were read were valid.

   In this scenario, it is required to wait for the result of the
   atomic instruction, even if the value itself is not checked.  This
   guarantees that if the atomic instruction succeeded in taking the lock,
   the lock was held before any reads in the critical section issued.  */

/* Access the given variable in memory exactly once.

   In some contexts, an algorithm may need to force access to memory,
   since otherwise the compiler may think it can optimize away a
   memory load or store; for example, in a loop when polling memory to
   see if another cpu has updated it yet.  Generally this is only
   required for certain very carefully hand-tuned algorithms; using it
   unnecessarily may result in performance losses.

   A related use of this macro is to ensure that the compiler does not
   rematerialize the value of "x" by reloading it from memory
   unexpectedly; the "volatile" marking will prevent the compiler from
   being able to rematerialize.  This is helpful if an algorithm needs
   to read a variable without locking, but needs it to have the same
   value if it ends up being used several times within the algorithm.

   Note that multiple uses of this macro are guaranteed to be ordered,
   i.e. the compiler will not reorder stores or loads that are wrapped
   in atomic_access_once().  */
